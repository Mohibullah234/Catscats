            <h2>Figuring out Cats personalities.</h2>
            <p>Cats are generally thought of as independent, aloof, and a little grumpy; it is said that sometimes even they loathe humans. 
            That probably raises the question in the minds of many: 
            Do cats really hate us? 
            The answer is more complex than a simple yes or no.</p>
            <h3>Interpretation of Cat Behavior</h3>
            <p>Cats are often misunderstood because their way of showing affection is different from what one would get from a dog, 
            or even a human being. 
            Unlike dogs who wag their tails and jump up and down every time they see you, 
            cats usually have more subtle signs when it comes to showing affection.</p>
            <p>Just consider a few:</p>
            <h4>1. Independence: </h4> 
               <p>Cats are also just innately independent animals. Now, this does not mean they do not love you;
                it just means that they do not attach to you the same way dogs do for companionship.
                They respect their alone time, but that does not mean they hate being around you.</p>
            <h4>2. Body language:</h4>
                <p>The body language of a cat can sometimes be challenging to comprehend. A cat might purr when it is happy, but it might also purr if it is feeling anxious. 
                Similarly, a cat might sit on the other side of the room staring at you, which seems standoffish to us, but to a cat, that might indicate that it actually trusts you.</p>
            <h4>3. Affectionate signs:</h4> 
                <p>Cats can express their affection toward you in so many ways. They rub against your legs, purr when you stroke them, or might even bring you "presents" 
                such as a dead mouse or toy. That basically shows trust and care.</p>
                <p>FYI, if you don't remember what a cat looks like, here's an image for reference:</p>

            <h3>Why Cats Sometimes Appear to Be Unfriendly</h3>
                <p>Here are some factors that can make a cat seem unfriendly or even aggressive:</p>
            <h4>1. Personal Space:</h4> 
                <p>Cats emphasize this a lot. If a cat feels crowded or handled too much, the person who handles it may experience backlash.</p>
            <h4>2. Past experiences:</h4> 
                <p>Cats with bad experiences can create more suspicion or fear associated with human beings; they can be unruly in case they dislike something.</p>
            <h4>3. Health Issues:</h4>
                <p>A cat that seems grumpy or aggressive at times might, in some cases, be in pain or feel unwell. Close attention should be paid to the health and behavior of a cat.</p>

        </style>
            <h3>The Bottom Line</h3> 
                <p>Cats are not haters of their owners; actually, most cats become attached to their human owners.</p>
